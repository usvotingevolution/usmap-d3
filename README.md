D3 map of the US that changes based on the value the state was admitted in the csv file.

To run use `python3 -m http.server 8080`

I used d3 map from another repository: This visualization was built by modifying [choropleth example code by Scott Murray](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_12/05_choropleth.html), [tooltip example code by Malcolm Maclean](http://www.d3noob.org/2013/01/adding-tooltips-to-d3js-graph.html), and [legend code example by Mike Bostock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3888852).
